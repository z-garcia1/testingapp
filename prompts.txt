Meeting agenda
Create a well-structured meeting agenda that effectively organizes discussion topics and time allocation. Include a clear meeting title, date, time, location/platform, and attendees list. Present agenda items in a logical sequence, from high to low priority, with estimated time blocks for each topic. Specify discussion leaders or presenters for each item, along with any pre-meeting preparation required. Include space for both standing items and new business, while ensuring topics align with the meetingâ€™s core objectives. Add relevant document attachments or reference materials needed for review. Format the agenda with clear headings, bullet points where necessary, and leave room for notes. Close with next steps, action items, and details for the next scheduled meeting. Keep the overall structure concise yet comprehensive enough to guide productive discussion.

Analyze files
Analyze all provided files, summarizing each page comprehensively while extracting exact quotes relevant to key themes, technical insights, or strategic implications. Ensure that the summaries are accurate, concise, and structured for clarity. For each extracted quote, include its source file and page number for reference. Once all pages are summarized, conduct a comparative analysis across the documents, identifying common themes, key differences, and unique insights. Highlight contradictions, reinforcing points, and knowledge gaps between sources. Finally, assess the relevance of the findings to Texas Instruments, focusing on industry trends, semiconductor advancements, market positioning, competitive strategies, and potential implications for business operations, innovation, or leadership in the sector. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the findings.

Translate
Translate the provided text into [TARGET LANGUAGE] while preserving its original meaning, tone, and intent. Ensure grammatical accuracy, cultural relevance, and linguistic fluency. Retain technical, legal, or industry-specific terminology where applicable, using standard terminology in the target language. Maintain formatting, structure, and any numerical values exactly as they appear. If a phrase has multiple valid translations, prioritize the most contextually appropriate one. Do not introduce or omit any information. If a term has no direct equivalent, provide the closest natural translation while preserving intent. Where ambiguity exists, choose the most precise and neutral interpretation. If the document contains idiomatic expressions, translate them in a way that retains their meaning rather than a literal word-for-word translation.
